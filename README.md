# Stardew Valley Randomizer (More Random Edition)

An update for cTooshi's Stardew Valley Randomizer to fix errors, add new features and make the existing features more random.

## Installation

Right now you have to build it yourself from the source code. You can find instructions on the Stardew Valley wiki on how to set up Visual Studio to do so: https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/Get_Started

## Changes from Original Randomizer

* Crafting recipe randomization
  * Recipes are now created based on randomly selected items from a pool (not randomly selected premade recipes)
  * Crafting difficulty is balanced based on necessity of the item and difficulty of crafting the item in vanilla
* Forageable randomization
  * Forageables for every season and location are now randomly selected from all forageables + fruit (normally from trees)
  * Every forageable appears at least once per year, and some may appear more than once
* Fruit tree randomization
  * Fruit tree saplings are now item saplings that grow a randomly selected item
* Music randomization
  * Most in-game songs and ambience are now randomly swapped 1 to 1 with another in-game song or ambience

## Planned Features

* Fish randomization
  * Randomize what fish appear in each season
* Quest randomization
  * Randomize what items the quests (in letters) require
* Crop randomization
  * Randomize what season crops can grow/be bought in and their planting time
  * Randomize crop names
* Bundle randomization
  * Add more bundles that are semi-random; bundles will be themed and their requirements randomly selected from a pool of items that fit the theme
  * Add some bundles made of completely random items
* Villager trait randomization
  * Randomize villagers' birthdays
  * Randomize villagers' likes and dislikes
* Palette randomization (if possible)
  * Randomly shift the color of the in-game graphics towards a different hue
  
## Known Issues

* Settings file for choosing what to randomize is not completely implemented
